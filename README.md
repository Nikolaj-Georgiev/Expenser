# Family Expenses App

This is a React project app that helps you manage your family expenses. You can create budgets, track spending, and generate reports for your household. ðŸ’°

- Used React, react-router-dom v6.4, Redux Toolkit, Framer Motion and Supabase for backend and DB
- I've deployed the main branch to show some concept but now I am transitioning the whole project to Typescrypt. There are some UI flaws but they will be fixed after the transition.
- I will also add Tanstack Querry in combination with the react-router v6.4 actions and loaders.
- For the moment only Authentication works. You can create account and hopefully at some point in time you can use it.
